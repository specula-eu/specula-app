## Purpose

This is the repository for the Specula app. Specula is a web application that allows investigative media professionals to increase their safety by raising awareness for their work. By marking themselves on an interactive map, the professionals can inform audiences about their work, their security and possible threats to their physical or psychological integrity. Audiences, public institutions and NGOs everywhere become able to follow what these professionals are doing, interact with them and press regional authorities to uphold the law and protect freedom of speech.

1. Ensure you have `backticks` to make text within `code` notation.
2. To create a hierarchy to show a `specific` folder.
    ```sh
    cd my-project/specific
    ```
3. You can make [links](/docs) with this notation.
    ```This is how you create a comment for a larger code chunk.
    REPO_DOCS='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MichaelCurrin/docsify-js-template/master/docs/'
    curl $REPO_DOCS\{_coverpage.md,_sidebar.md,.nojekyll,index.html,README.md\} -O
    ```

### Customize

**Here** is bold text notation.

## Setup and run

Docsify should run without new local installs, but here is the [installation tutorial](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/docsify-js-tutorial/#/).
### Remote use

### Serve locally

To see the Docsify site locally, run `docsify serve`. While installing I needed to use `docsify init` but I believe it's only for the first install (if `docsify serve` does not work, it wil probably tell you what to do.)
